## Description

The circuit board is an integrated ESP32S3 and FPGA (GW1NSR-LV4CQN48PC6/I5) control chip. With the power management AXP2101 can be used to switch the voltage of different BANK areas. And there are as many as 6 data lines for communication between FPGA and MCU.

## Where to buy

T-FPGA is available from: [LILYGO](https://www.lilygo.cc/products/t-fpga), [Aliexpress](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/T-FPGA).

## Quick Start 
>## ESP32-S3:
>The board uses USB as the JTAG upload port. When printing serial port information >on USB, CDC_ON_BOOT configuration needs to be turned on. 
>If the port cannot be found when uploading the program or the USB has been used >for other functions, the port does not appear. 
>Please enter the upload mode manually. 
>-  Press and hold the BOOT button when the power is off, the button is located >behind the RST button.
>-  When the USB is connected, first press and hold the BOOT button, then click >reset and then release the BOOT button

## Q&A
1. Q: Connecting the FPGA-JTAG USB interface does not pop up a new device or the program cannot be successfully uploaded to the FPGA chip
- A: Because the BANK area of the FPGA chip requires different power supply voltages. During initialization, the ESP32-S3 needs to correct the voltage of the PMU and turn it on before it can work normally.

- The solution is to let ESP32-S3 upload `T-FPGA\example\ESP32-S3\turn_on_power` program first. The purpose of this procedure is to turn on the PMU voltage.
